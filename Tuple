'''Tuple'''

# A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of items. Can be declared using parenthesis as opposed to square brackets.

a_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# Two Tuple Methods: .count() and .index()

mvps = ('Allen Iverson', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tim Duncan', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Steve Nash', 'Steve Nash', 'Dirk Nowitzki', 'Kobe Bryant', 'LeBron James', 'LeBron James')

print(mvps.index('Steve Nash')) # will return the index of where the item called occurred. 

# However, if an item appears multiple times in the tuple, only the index of the first occurence of that item will be returned.

print(mvps.count('Tim Duncan')) #Count will return how many times the parameter passed into the method call occurs in the tuple.
print()

# Single item tuples can be declared in the following formats:
one_element_tup = (4)
print(type(one_element_tup))

one_element_tup = (4,)
new_one_element_tup = 'a',
other_one_element_tup = tuple([0.8])

print(one_element_tup, new_one_element_tup, other_one_element_tup)
print()

# Tuples are immutable, but if objects within tuples are mutable, you can reference those objects and modify them
bob_tuple = ('Bob', '70 inches', ['Denver, CO'])
bob_tuple[2][0] = 'Atlanta, GA'
print(bob_tuple)
